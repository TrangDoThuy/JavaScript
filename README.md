# JavaScript
## The Iterator Interface
When called, that method should return an object that provides a second interface, iterator. This is the actual thing that iterates. It has a next method that returns the next result. That result should be an object with a value property that provides the next value, if there is one, and a done property, which should be true when there are no more results and false otherwise.
